    "Sports analytics has become a popular application of statistics. Driven by large amounts of data and revenue generated by sports, many analysts have leveraged data to help teams make important decisions. In this exercise, we will use data and probability to predict the winner of a soccer game. More specifically, we will produce real-time predictions for a penalty shoot-out just like those generated by the analytics website <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-chart-for-predicting-penalty-shootout-odds-in-real-time/\" target=\"_blank\">FiveThirtyEight</a>.\n",

    "In a soccer tournament when the teams have an equal number of goals after 120 minutes, the winner is decided by a penalty shoot-out. In a penalty shoot-out, each team designates players to shoot the ball at the goal, which is defended by a goalkeeper. This is called a \"penalty kick.\" Each teams gets five opportunities to score. The team that scores the most penalty kicks in those five turns wins. If the teams score an equal number of penalty kicks after five rounds the shootout becomes \"sudden death.\" Each team will take one more additional penalty kick. In each one of these additional rounds, if one team scores and one team misses, the game is over and the team who made the final penalty kick wins. If both teams miss or both teams score, then the teams proceed to another round of sudden death.\n",
